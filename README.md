# IVR-audit-project
Implementation of IVR system integration into the workflow studio.
Calls checked to see IVR usage and whether it is creating any impact in timely responses from our end.
Proposed the implementation of IVR system integration into the workflow studio based on thorough analysis of communication volume, leading to an 18% increase in overall call pickup rate & a 15% reduction in customer Turnaround time (TAT).
